## This is an investment

I love to keep things simple so here is some information about my rates and pricing.

## What is your hourly rate?

I don’t have one. Every project I work on is value based. If what I am doing is not providing value for you, I don’t want you to hire me.

When pricing is based on the value I provide I get to put my focus on making exactly what you need. I get to be focused on solving your problem using all of my skills.

My project based rates also include the following advantages which are really hard to pack into an hourly rate:

- Conversion focused
- Mobile design expert
- Well documented code
- Goal oriented mindset
- Simple solutions
- Recommendations based on my experiences
- Accessibility on my mind
- Business mindset
- Eye for design

## What is your starting cost for a project?

Most web design projects start at $6,000 and go up from there depending on scope.

My goal is to create what you need to reach your goals, not what ends up being the biggest check for me. This approach gives you the best chance at exceeding what you want to accomplish which in turn will have you recommending me to all your friends (90% of my business is from referrals).

Sometimes the best solution for you is not a custom built website. Instead we can start with a child theme and test your idea before building the ultimate website. These projects start at $2,000.

## Why did (insert other agency/freelancers name here) give me a quote that is much less than yours?

If you are more focused on the price than the outcome provided I am probably not the right person.

Not all websites are created equally. If you just want a website for as cheap as possible then fast freddie might be a good option.

If you want to create an experience your website visitors will love so that you can crush your goals, let’s get started.

## What does working with you look like?

It’s awesome if I don’t say so myself.

I value communication and will keep you in the loop. I also get really focused on your project and the goals and forget about feelings. I may say a few things that ruffle some feathers, but what good idea doesn’t?

I respect your time so we won’t be doing any meetings about the next meeting, but we may need to have quick focused discussions about your project.

I give your project my all, and you should be prepared to do the same.

## When can you start?

I am currently booked through April 2020. I can accommodate 2 clients per month but the spots fill up quickly. If you want to work together get in touch now and let’s see if we are a good fit.

## I need my website started yesterday!

Sometimes you can’t wait, I get that. I may be able to help. Get in touch to learn more about my rush project rates.
