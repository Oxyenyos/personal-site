I enjoy reading/listening to books and always curious what others are reading. Mostly I enjoy reading from categories such as Science Fiction, Personal Development, Psycology or Technology.

I thought Iâ€™d share my bookshelf here with you. The books that I particularly enjoyed are starred. The list is not in any particular order.

If you want to suggest a book send me an email or drop a comment below.
